    "# The Myopic Mechanic\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a car owner (let's call him \"Mitt\") facing the problem of when to take his car to the mechanic for service. We assume that Mitt makes one vehicle service decision per month, at the beginning of each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ denote the total miles on the car, and $z$ denote the number of miles since the last service visit (both measured in thousands). Conditional on the total mileage $x$ and the miles since last service $z$, Mitt perceives expected beginning-of-month benefit from operating the car given by\n",

    "\n",
    "If Mitt visits the mechanic, he will incur an expected cost $C(x, z)$ specified above. However, visiting the mechanic resets the number of miles $z$ since the last service visit to zero, allowing Mitt to realize benefit $U(x,0)$ over the rest of the month. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of every month, Mitt decides whether or not to take his car to the mechanic. \n",

    "\n",
    "Note that Mitt is *myopic*, in the sense that he considers only costs and benefits of maintenance within the current month, not prospective benefits in future months from maintaining the car today. We will return to the case of a forward-looking mechanic (Harold Zurcher, the subject of a seminal 1987 paper by John Rust) when we introduce dynamic discrete choice analysis.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where the last line follows by the i.i.d. Type I extreme value assumption on the idiosyncratic utility shocks $\\epsilon_0, \\epsilon_1$ (again, much more on this soon!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the following features of the predicted probability-of-service function $P(x,z)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The terms $a_0 + a_1x$ which appear in both $V_1$ and $V_0$ disappear from the choice probability function. We thus cannot identify either $a_0$ or $a_1$, since these do not affect the choice we observe. In other words, we cannot identify the effects of mileage per se on utility from driving the car; we can only identify effects of mileage insofar as they affect the relative costs of service.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Only differences $(\\rho_1 - c_1)$ and $(\\rho_2 - c_2)$ show up in the choice probability function. In this particular example, we can thus only identify the effect of mileage since last service on the differential costs of service versus not.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Since the scale of utility is arbitrary, we can identify these differences only up to scale. In assuming that $\\epsilon_0$ and $\\epsilon_1$ were i.i.d. Type 1 EV, we implicitly imposed a normalization on the variances of $\\epsilon_0$ and $\\epsilon_1$. Scaling all terms in utility by any positive constant would lead to the same choice probabilities.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Are these identified objects enough? It depends on the counterfactual of interest. For example, if we want to determine how cutting the base cost $c_0$ of a service visit in half would affect the frequency of service, we could do so. If we wanted to determine how a dollar subsidy to service would affect frequency of service, we could not, since in this simple exercise we have no way to convert estimated utilities into dollar terms. For this, we would need to observe variation in price of service, from which we abstract for the moment (as price raises a separate set of endogeneity questions which we will address in detail later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Bearing the above caveats in mind, redefine $\\gamma_0=c_0$, $\\gamma_1 = \\rho_1 - c_1$, and $\\gamma_2 = \\rho_2 - c_2$. These are the primitives which data on Mitt's service choices can identify. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of the exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we observe panel data $(d_{it}, x_{it}, z_{it})_{t=1}^T$ on monthly mileage and service decisions for a collection of individuals $i=1,...,N$, interpreted as a random sample of the population. For simplicity, assume a balanced panel (i.e., the same $T$ for all $i$), although this is inessential.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to estimate the parameter vector $\\gamma = (\\gamma_0, \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2)$, assuming that each individual is making auto maintenance choices according to the model described above. Toward this end, we will consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CMLE estimation based on the predicted choice probability function $P(x_{it}, z_{it}; \\gamma)$ derived above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. GMM estimation based on the conditional mean restriction \n",
    "\t$$E[d_{it} - P(x_{it}, z_{it}; \\gamma) | x_{it}, z_{it}] = 0.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, given that we have a fully specified choice model, CMLE will be more efficient, but we also consider GMM for illustrative purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a sense for how the estimators compare, we will simulate several Monte Carlo datasets, then explore the performance of each estimator in these simulations. \n",
    "I will provide code for this exercise in Julia, although (for those using other programs) it may be worthwhile to replicate this exercise in other languages."

The latter transformation is useful to ensure numerical stability, as for some values of $w$ and $\\gamma$, the product $w'\\gamma$ could become very large, so that $\\exp(w'\\gamma)$ becomes machine infinity. Normalizing by the maximum of mean utilities prevents such numerical overflow, and ensures that the predicted choice probability $P(w, \\gamma)$ is always numerically stable. This is good programming practice when working with logit models, and is illustrated in the code below."

    "We first estimate the model by CMLE. Under the assumptions described above, the choice probability function $P(w_{it}; \\gamma_0)$ completely specifies the marginal density of the choice $d_{it}$ given contemporateous covariates $w_{it}$. Furthermore, by hypothesis, individual $i$'s choice in period $t$ does not depend on lagged realizations of $d_{it}$ and $w_{it}$ for individual $i$, although current $w_{it}$ will generally not be independent of lagged $w_{i,t-1}$ for a given individual. In other words, in the language of panel data analysis, our model is *dynamically complete*, which allows us to apply standard MLE asymptotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In this context, dynamic completeness essentially requires that, conditional on current covariates $w_{it}$, current choices $d_{it}$ are independent of past choices $d_{i,t-\\tau}$ and past covariates $w_{i,t-\\tau}$. Since we have assumed independence of utility shocks $\\epsilon_{i0t}, \\epsilon_{i1t}$ across periods, this is true in our context. If these errors were not independent, but the marginal choice probability function $P(w_{it}; \\gamma_0)$ were otherwise correctly specified, we could consider *partial MLE analysis*, which involves maximizing the same marginal objective function, but requires a general quasi-MLE approach asymptotic inference since the conditional information matrix no longer holds. See Wooldridge 13.8 for a detailed discussion.) \n",

    "In practice, there are many ways to choose the Hessian approximator $H^k$. Some leading examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The exact Hessian, potentially adjusted to ensure negative definiteness if necessary: e.g. $H^k = \\mathcal{H}_N(\\gamma^{k}) - \\lambda^k I$, where $\\lambda^k \\geq 0$ is chosen to ensure negative definiteneness (e.g., $\\lambda^k = 0$ if $\\mathcal{H}_N(\\gamma^{k})$ is already negative definite, otherwise $\\lambda^k$ strictly exceeds the maximum positive eigenvalue of $\\mathcal{H}_N(\\gamma^{k})$). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For MLE models, the Berndt–Hall–Hall–Hausman (BHHH) step is available, which defines $-H^k$ as the sum of outer products of scores computed above. This substitution is justified by the information matrix equality, which tells us that close to the optimum the negative expected Hessian $-A_0$ should equal the expected score variance $B_0$. For MLE models, the BHHH step has two practical advantages. First, it only requires us to evaluate scores, not Hessians. Second, since the outer product of scores is always positive definite, the BHHH approximation ensures that we can always find an improvement in the objective function along the BHHH step direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, which constructs an iterative approximation $H^k$ to the actual Hessian $\\mathcal{H}_N(\\gamma^{k})$ using only information on the score $\\mathcal{S}_N(\\gamma^{k})$ at each step, in such a way that $-H^k$ is always positive definite. Computationally, the BFGS algorithm is attractive in settings where the exact Hessian $\\mathcal{H}_N(\\gamma^{k})$ is difficult to compute, since BFGS requires only information on the score (which we need to compute anyway) to construct the approximation $H^k$. Furthermore, as with BHHH, BFGS ensures that we can always find an improvement along the search direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we have already computed both the Hessian and outer product of scores, so both the exact Hessian and BHHH approaches are available. We explore both approaches."
